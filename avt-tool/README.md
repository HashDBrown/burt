# AVT

AVT is screen-recording desktop app that we developed, which allows humans (e.g., end users or developers) to collect screen recordings and *getevent* traces from a mobile device or emulator by simply clicking a record button. The tool internally uses the Android screen recorder that is executed by Androidâ€™s ADB tool.

The detailed instructions for using this AVT can be found [here](https://github.com/sea-lab-wm/burt/tree/tool-demo/trace-replayer/AVT-instructions.pdf).
