  <title>OI Notepad: Sort order does not work with encrypted notes</title>
  <description>```
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. In OI Notepad, choose alphabetical sort ordering.
2. Encrypted notes appear at seemingly random places.

Encrypted notes are sorted according to their encrypted version, not 
according to the decrypted string.
