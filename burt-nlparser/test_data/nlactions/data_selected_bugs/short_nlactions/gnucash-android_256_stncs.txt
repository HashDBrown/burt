"* [0] Autocomplete problems -> [S_OB_ERROR_NOUN_PHRASE]"
"* [1.1] (My experience with this bug relates to issue #254 but is perhaps separate.) -> [S_OB_VERB_ERROR, S_OB_BUT, S_OB_ERROR_AS_SUBJECT]"
"* [2.1] When I create an entry for a purchase, the autocomplete list shows up, per usual. -> [S_OB_COND_POS, S_OB_OUTPUT_VERB]"
"* [2.2] If I pick one of the suggestions, the previous amount associated with that suggestion populates the field (normal behavior). -> [S_OB_COND_POS]"
"* [2.3] Even if I change the value before saving the entry, the old value is retained. -> [S_SR_COND_OBS, S_OB_COND_NEG, S_OB_NEG_ADV_ADJ, S_OB_ERROR_AS_SUBJECT, S_OB_ERROR_NOUN_PHRASE]"
"* [2.4] Editing the entry later has the same result, the old transaction amount sticks. -> [S_OB_NEG_VERB, S_OB_NEG_ADV_ADJ, S_OB_ERROR_AS_SUBJECT, S_OB_ERROR_NOUN_PHRASE, S_OB_ACTION_SUBJECT]"
"* [2.5] Luckly I caught this before too many entries were affected. -> [S_SR_SIMPLE_PAST, S_OB_NEG_VERB, S_OB_NEG_ADV_ADJ]"
"* [3.2] The majority of my transactions are not repetitive (different dollar amounts at the same stores, varying bills each month, etc), and it ends up creating a lot more work than it saves me time. -> [S_OB_NEG_AUX_VERB, S_OB_NEG_ADV_ADJ, S_OB_ERROR_AS_SUBJECT]"
"* [4.1] Thanks for your hard work on this project! -> [S_OB_NEG_ADV_ADJ]"
