    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Crash on Nexus 4, ACV 1.4.1.4:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">1. start the app</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">2. click menu</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">3. choose "open"</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">4. go to directories like /mnt</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">5. long-press a folder, like "secure"</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">6. crash</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The reason is that, when you don't have permission, File.list() would return null.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">But this is not checked.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">The problem happens in src/net/robotmedia/acv/ui/SDBrowserActivity.java:111, where you called file.list() and later used the result.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">The return code may be null.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">In this case, it's due to permission, so maybe it's not that interesting.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">However, it may also return null due to other reasons.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">Anyway, showing an error message is better than crashing.</sentence>
