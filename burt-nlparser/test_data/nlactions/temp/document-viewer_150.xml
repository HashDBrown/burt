    <title>enhancement: slider to browse through large books</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When reading a large book or using single page view it can be awkward to quickly jump to a faraway page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">It would be nice if there was a horizontal slider that let a person flip quickly to at least the general area.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">It'd be especially nice if the slider had detents marking chapters.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">I imagine it being enabled the same as the zoom wheel.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">This would also satisfy readers who like to have a progress bar as they read.</sentence>
