            <sentence id="2.1">When I create an entry for a purchase, the autocomplete list shows up, per usual.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">If I pick one of the suggestions, the previous amount associated with that suggestion populates the field (normal behavior).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">Even if I change the value before saving the entry, the old value is retained.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">Editing the entry later has the same result, the old transaction amount sticks.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">Luckly I caught this before too many entries were affected.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I would like to be able to completely disable the autocomplete feature, or at least disable the automatic population of the transaction amount.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">The majority of my transactions are not repetitive (different dollar amounts at the same stores, varying bills each month, etc), and it ends up creating a lot more work than it saves me time.</sentence>
