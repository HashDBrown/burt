            <st ob="" eb="" sr="" id="5.2">Which is odd, because the text at the top says "Since you have chosen Android KeyStore as encryption method this is optional."</st>

            <st ob="" eb="" sr="" id="5.4">But the red text indicates it is not optional.</st>
            <st ob="" eb="" sr="" id="5.5">I think this is just a UX bug and an unfortunate coincidence that "Password" is still the default even though "Android KeyStore" was selected.</st>
            <st ob="" eb="" sr="" id="5.6">Maybe it should default to "None" to align with what the text says?</st>
