  <title>Links within Wikipedia don't work any more</title>
  <description>I have installed the most recent release of aard on my Samsung Galaxy Note together with the current version of the German Wikipedia. I use the recent nightlies of the Omnirom custom ROM (Android 4.4.3).

When I tap on a link to another Wikipedia article, aard displays an empty (blank) page thereafter instead of the other article.
