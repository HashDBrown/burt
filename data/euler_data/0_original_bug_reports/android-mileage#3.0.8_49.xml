  <title>Maximum Fillup cost under statistics displaying incorrectly</title>
  <description>```
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Enter incorrect price per km in a fillup (I entered 102.9 rather than 1.029)
2. switch to statistics view and see calculations
3. Find the incorrect entry in history and fix the price.

Expected behavior:
After fixing the price in History the statistics should recalculate and show 
the proper Maximum cost.

Actual behavior:
Maximum cost still shows the skewed value based on the old price.

Mileage version: 3.0.8
Android version: 2.3.4
Device: First on HTC Magic still persists on HTC EVO 3D

Please provide any additional information below.
Tried hitting recalculate in the statistics page but it still comes up with the 
incorrect Maximum Cost.
