  <title>No More Than 1 Service Interval at a Time???</title>
  <description>```
What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. Open Mileage Tracker
2. Negotiate to the "Service Intervals" screen
3. "Add Service Interval"

Expected behavior:
I expect to be able to enter all of my upcoming services, like the next oil 
change AND the next State Inspection.

Actual behavior:
Hello. I just installed your app, and it is very nice. To begin, I entered the 
information for my next oil change. No problem. Then I added a second 
service... my yearly State Inspection. But, when I entered the second one, it 
erased the first one. Any ideas???

Mileage version: Mileage 3.1.1
Android version: 4.1.2
Device: Droid Razar M

Please provide any additional information below.
