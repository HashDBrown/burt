  <title>Export to Google Drive silently fails</title>
  <description>Not sure if this is an issue related to 2.1.3, or if Google changed their API, but export to Google Drive seems to be silently failing.

#### Steps to reproduce the behaviour
1. Select "Export..." from left tray
2. Select export to "Google Drive", format QIF, default value for "Since"
3. Check "Delete transactions after export"
4. Tap "EXPORT"

#### Expected behaviour
Transactions to be deleted
Message "Exported to: Google Drive -&gt; GnuCash"
QIF file to be in appropriate directory in Google Drive

#### Actual behaviour
Transactions are deleted (!)
Message "Exported to: Google Drive -&gt; GnuCash"
No new file anywhere in Google Drive

#### Software specifications
* GnuCash Android version: 2.1.3
* System Android version: 6.0
* Device type: Moto X Pure Edition
