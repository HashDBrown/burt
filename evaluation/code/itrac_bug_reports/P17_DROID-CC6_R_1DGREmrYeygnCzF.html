        <p><b>Observed Behavior (a description of what happened with the app): </b></p>

        <p><b>Additional information: </b></p>
        <p>The nature of what "Add previous comment" should do is unclear: I am unsure of exactly what the expected behavior should be. When the option is selected before any comments have been added to any entries, an interface appears but states that there are no comments yet. I presume that this means that the option is meant to allow users to copy the text of comments made on previous entries to new ones, but I am unsure of this.</p>
