        <p><b>Bug summary:</b></p>
        <p>Balance sheet duplicated after hitting back from settings</p>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Observed Behavior (a description of what happened with the app): </b></p>
        <p>I opened the left sidebar menu and went to check out reports (specifically, sheets). Then, I went back to the left sidebar to check settings, clicked nothing on settings, and instead hit the back arrow in the top left corner to return to the sheets report and suddenly all the lines inside the assets, liabilities, and equities were doubled (duplicated). For example, there were two totals in bold for each section.</p>

        <p><b>Expected Behavior (a description of what you expected to happen): </b></p>
        <p>I expected to hit back from the settings page and restore the same (non-duplicated) sheets page I had seen seconds earlier.</p>
