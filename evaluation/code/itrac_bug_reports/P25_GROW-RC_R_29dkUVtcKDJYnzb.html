        <p><b>Bug summary:</b></p>
        <p>Attempting to duplicate a plant makes the tracker crash.</p>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Observed Behavior (a description of what happened with the app): </b></p>
        <p>The behavior leading up to duplicating the plant is as expected and works without issues. When I press the duplicate button, a popup appears with the message "Tracker has stopped" and I'm given the option to re-open the app. When I reopen the app the plant that I created is still there, but there is no duplicate as requested.</p>

        <p><b>Expected Behavior (a description of what you expected to happen): </b></p>
        <p>Instead of crashing, I expect the app to create an identical copy of the plant that a user selects; with the same details, dates, information, and images. I also expect the app to do this without crashing or requiring a restart.</p>
