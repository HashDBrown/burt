        <p><b>Bug summary:</b></p>
        <p>After initially setting up the app, the “Balance Sheet” duplicates if you navigate to “Settings” and then back to the balance sheet page. </p>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Observed Behavior (a description of what happened with the app): </b></p>
        <p>After navigating initial app setup, click "Reports" under the dropdown menu at left, then the pink "Sheets" button, and then "Settings" on the left dropdown menu. Then, use the back arrow in upper left corner to navigate back to the "Balance Sheet." The Balance Sheet shows each line under Assets, Liabilities, and Equity twice. The repeated text lines occur as a group (i.e. the lines appear in the correct order, and then the sequence repeats a second time); see screenshot below. </p>
