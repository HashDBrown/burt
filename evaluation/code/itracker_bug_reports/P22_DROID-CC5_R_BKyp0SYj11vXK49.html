        <p><b>Observed Behavior (a description of what happened with the app): </b></p>
        <p>I opened DroidWeight and went to statistics, hit BMI, entered 50 for height and 60 for weight and the app crashed.</p>

        <p><b>Expected Behavior (a description of what you expected to happen): </b></p>
        <p>I expected the app to calculate a BMI index for me or specify that my input was weird (I kind of put bad numbers and I'm not sure what the units were) but it just crashed instead.</p>
