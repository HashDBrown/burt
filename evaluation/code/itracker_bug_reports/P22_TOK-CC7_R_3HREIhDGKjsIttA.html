        <p><b>Bug summary:</b></p>
        <p>Add Token does not create token</p>
        <hr />
        <p><b>Observed Behavior (a description of what happened with the app): </b></p>
        <p>I created a test token (named it "test") with a random seed and no other information provided and it did not show up when i hit "done". This was also the first ever token I had created (I didn't have other tokens) so maybe that plays a role. Additionally, it was an "Event token" and I didn't enter anything in the serial # field or OTP length field (OTP was prefilled with 6 I believe).</p>

        <p><b>Expected Behavior (a description of what you expected to happen): </b></p>
        <p>I expected my newly created "test" token to appear</p>
